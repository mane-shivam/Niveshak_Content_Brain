## POST-RUN CHECKLIST

Before publishing:

- [ ] All 3 main posts summarized
- [ ] Frameworks reinforced listed
- [ ] Key learnings extracted (not just repeated content)
- [ ] Common thread identified (if exists)
- [ ] Preview included (if known)
- [ ] Institutional voice maintained
- [ ] Length appropriate (300-400 words)
- [ ] Focus on value delivered, not promotional
- [ ] Loop Closed: Emerging/reinforced frameworks logged in system files

---

## FILES TO UPDATE AFTER RUN

1. **Log emerging framework**: If new framework identified, add to `04-operations/idea_backlog.md` (as candidate)
2. **Log reinforced framework**: Update `00-bible/frameworks_index.md`
3. **Log failed narrative**: If "narrative that broke" identified, log in `04-operations/failure_log.md`

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Being promotional** → "Amazing week!" is not our voice  
❌ **Just listing posts** → Synthesize, don't just recap  
❌ **Missing framework connections** → Show how frameworks compound  
❌ **Too long** → Should be scannable in 2 minutes  
❌ **No key learnings** → What did readers actually gain?  
❌ **Ignoring common threads** → If posts connect thematically, say so  

---

## DRIFT RISKS

Watch for:
- **Becoming promotional**: "Don't miss out!" type language
- **Losing substance**: Becoming summary without synthesis
- **Missing frameworks**: Not highlighting the mental models taught
- **Getting formulaic**: Same structure every week without thought

**Prevention**: Always ask "What did readers learn this week?" not "What did we publish?"

## EXAMPLE GOOD VS. BAD

### ✅ GOOD
```
NIVESHAK WEEKLY DIGEST
Week of 12-18 Jan 2026

THIS WEEK WE COVERED:

Sunday: Zomato's Marketing Efficiency Paradox
Marketing spend dropped 22% YoY while orders grew 31%—
a textbook case of operating leverage inflecting at scale.

Tuesday: Swiggy Q3 FY26
Revenue growth of 28% masked operating cash flow burn 
of ₹250 Cr for the fifth straight quarter. 
Growth quality matters more than growth rate.

Friday: SEBI's RPT Disclosure Update
New rules close a ₹4,200 Cr disclosure loophole affecting 
~150 companies. Governance scrutiny intensifies.

FRAMEWORKS REINFORCED:
- Operating Leverage (Zomato analysis)
- Cash Flow Quality vs. Revenue Growth (Swiggy)
- Governance Red Flags (RPT disclosure patterns)

KEY LEARNINGS:
1. Operating leverage works both ways—scale can drive efficiency 
   or magnify problems depending on unit economics
2. Revenue growth without cash generation signals sustainability risk
3. Regulatory tightening cycles make governance a competitive advantage

Common thread: This week examined the gap between reported 
metrics and underlying quality—whether marketing efficiency, 
cash generation, or disclosure transparency.

NEXT WEEK:
Quarterly earnings continue. We'll examine [specific company 
if known] with focus on [angle if planned].
```

**Why Good**: Synthesizes, not just lists. Highlights frameworks. Extracts learnings. Finds common thread. Institutional voice.

### ❌ BAD
```
WEEKLY RECAP 🎉

Amazing week at Niveshak!

We published:
- Sunday post about Zomato
- Tuesday analysis of Swiggy
- Friday macro piece on SEBI

Check them out if you missed them!

Next week will be even better! 🔥

Don't forget to subscribe!
```

**Why Bad**: Promotional, no synthesis, no frameworks highlighted, no learnings, hype language, emoji overuse.

---

## COORDINATION WITH OTHER ENGINES

**Receives from**:
- All main content engines (Sunday/Tuesday/Friday)
- Market Correspondent (if posts this week)

**Purpose**:
- Close the week
- Show value delivered
- Reinforce frameworks
- Set up next week

**Distinct from**:
- Not a promotional tool
- Not a content preview primarily
- It's a synthesis and learning extraction

---

## SPECIAL NOTES

**Value Delivered, Not Hype**:
Weekly digest should make readers feel "I learned a lot this week" not "I should subscribe to not miss out."

**Framework Compounding Showcase**:
Use digest to show how frameworks build on each other across posts.

**Common Thread Detection**:
If posts connect thematically, explicitly state it. This shows strategic thinking, not random content.

**Preview Only If Known**:
Don't force a preview if next week's content isn't planned yet. "We're monitoring earnings season" is fine.
