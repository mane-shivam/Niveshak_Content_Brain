## 🎯 PURPOSE (MOST IMPORTANT ENGINE IN THE SYSTEM)

This engine's job is to **extract, refine, lock, and protect the core value of the post** before verification destroys it.

Specifically:

* Lock the **final thesis**
* Lock **3–5 core insights** (Tier 2 protected)
* Lock **1 killer metric**
* Classify all claims into Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3
* Preserve narrative essence before Cross Verification

This engine exists to solve:

* Verification deleting value
* Thesis drifting after patch
* Examples breaking the framework
* Final drafts becoming correct but empty

After this engine runs:

> 🔒 Cross-Verification and Patch are FORCED to work around the insight, not delete it.

---

## ⛔ ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY RULES

This engine has **final authority over insight**.

After this engine locks:

* Thesis
* Core insights
* Killer metric

No other engine may:

* Delete them
* Weaken them
* Drift them
* Replace them

Only **human override** may remove a locked insight.

---

## 🧠 WHAT THIS ENGINE ACTUALLY DOES

This engine performs six critical tasks:

### 1. THESIS DISTILLATION

Extract and finalize the single governing thesis.

### 2. CORE INSIGHT EXTRACTION

Select the **3–5 highest-value insights** across all drafts:

* Mechanisms
* Incentives
* Regime effects
* Cross-sector patterns

These become **Protected Tier 2 Insights**.

### 3. KILLER METRIC SELECTION

Choose exactly ONE metric that:

* Anchors the framework
* Summarizes the thesis
* Can travel across platforms

### 4. CLAIM TIER CLASSIFICATION

Every major claim must be classified:

* Tier 1 — Hard facts (must be sourced later)
* Tier 2 — Reasoning / interpretation (protected)
* Tier 3 — Speculation (must be deleted later)

### 5. INSIGHT COHERENCE CHECK

Ensure:

* Insights support the thesis
* Examples actually match the insight
* No internal contradictions

### 6. PROTECTED INSIGHT LOCK

Generate a formal block that downstream engines must obey.

---

## 🧠 INITIAL SEED PROMPT (THREAD STARTER)

Use this EXACT prompt.

```
You are Niveshak's INSIGHT DISTILLER.

Your job is to protect the intellectual core of this post before verification and editing destroy it.

ATTACHED:
- Deep Research Draft(s)
- niveshak_bible.md
- Framework context (if any)

MISSION:

From all drafts, extract and LOCK:

1. FINAL THESIS  
2. 3 to 5 CORE INSIGHTS (highest value only)  
3. ONE KILLER METRIC  
4. CLAIM TIER MAP  

RULES:

- Insight > Structure  
- Reasoning is protected (Tier 2)  
- Speculation must be killed (Tier 3)  
- Examples may change, insights may NOT  

WHAT TO DO:

STEP 1 — THESIS  
Extract the single governing thesis in 1–2 sentences.

STEP 2 — CORE INSIGHTS  
Select the 3–5 most powerful insights that:
- Change how investors think  
- Reveal hidden mechanisms  
- Explain incentives or regimes  
- Spot cross-sector patterns  

These will become PROTECTED INSIGHTS.

STEP 3 — KILLER METRIC  
Choose ONE metric that best anchors the thesis.

Explain why this metric is central.

STEP 4 — CLAIM TIER MAP  
List the major claims and classify:

- Tier 1: Facts (must be sourced later)  
- Tier 2: Reasoning / interpretation (protected)  
- Tier 3: Speculation (mark for deletion)

STEP 5 — COHERENCE CHECK  
Flag:
- Any insight not supported by examples  
- Any example that contradicts the thesis  
- Any internal conflict  

STEP 6 — PROTECTED INSIGHT LOCK  
Produce a final LOCK BLOCK that downstream engines must obey.

IMPORTANT:

- Do NOT rewrite the post  
- Do NOT polish language  
- Do NOT add new data  
- Do NOT remove insights unless logically invalid  

Your output becomes CONSTITUTIONAL INPUT for Cross Verification and Patch.

OUTPUT FORMAT EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED BELOW.
```

---

## 🔁 RESTART PROMPT (WHEN REVISING INSIGHTS)

```
You are continuing as Niveshak's INSIGHT DISTILLER.

PREVIOUS LOCK:
[Paste previous Protected Insight Block]

NEW INPUT:
- Updated research draft OR
- New data OR
- Feedback from Red Team / Verification

TASK:

- Re-evaluate thesis coherence  
- Strengthen core insights if needed  
- Replace weak examples WITHOUT changing insight  
- Update Tier classification  

RULES:
- Preserve intellectual essence  
- Never drift thesis without explicit reason  
- Flag any insight that becomes invalid  

OUTPUT:
Updated Protected Insight Lock Block
+ Change log (what changed and why)
```

This lock must be preserved by:

- ENGINE 05 — Cross Verification  
- ENGINE 06 — Controlled Patch  
- ENGINE 07 — Red Team

Protected insights may NOT be deleted.
Only examples and sources may change.

## 🔵 NEXT STEPS (AUTOMATIC ROUTING)

After this engine completes:

### Normal Flow:

```
ENGINE 05A → ENGINE 05 (Cross Verification)
```

With rule:

* Cross Verification may ONLY attack Tier 1 and Tier 3
* Tier 2 is protected

---

## 📒 LOGS TO MAINTAIN (MANDATORY)

After every run, update:

### 1. `insight_lock_log.md`

Append:

* Post ID
* Thesis
* Core insights summary
* Killer metric

This becomes your **institutional memory of insights**.

---

### 2. `framework_performance.md`

If insight introduces or tests a framework:

* Log framework used
* Insight outcome
* Later validation / failure

---

## 🗓️ WEEKLY CHECKLIST ADDITION

Add to `weekly_checklist.md`:

```
INSIGHT QUALITY CHECK:

- Were protected insights preserved through verification?
- Did any post lose its killer metric?
- Did thesis drift after patch?

If YES → Investigate system failure
```

---

## 🗓️ MONTHLY CHECKLIST ADDITION

Add to `monthly_checklist.md`:

```
INSIGHT HEALTH AUDIT:

Review last 10 Protected Insight Locks:

- % that survived to final post  
- % that materially changed  
- % that were later invalidated  

If invalidation rate > 10% → tighten Insight Distiller logic
If survival rate < 70% → patch / verification is too destructive
```

---

## 🔴 COMMON FAILURE MODES TO WATCH

This engine must avoid:

❌ Selecting too many insights
❌ Locking weak or generic insights
❌ Letting speculation into Tier 2
❌ Over-engineering the thesis
❌ Becoming a mini Apex (no rewriting allowed)

---

## 🟢 FINAL NOTE (VERY IMPORTANT)

This engine solves:

* your biggest system failure
* value destruction
* dead final drafts
* thesis drift
* incoherent examples

From now on:

> Verification serves insight.
> Patch preserves insight.
> Apex narrates insight.

This is how real research desks operate.
