## 5. Quality Gates (Pre-Output Check)

Before outputting, the Engine validates:
- [ ] Are at least 2 Edge dimensions present?
- [ ] Is there one killer metric?
- [ ] Is there one invalidation metric?
- [ ] Is the "Uncertainty Note" present?
- [ ] Are all banned phrases (delve, navigate, tapestry) removed?

## 6. Automation Rules

- **Pre-Reqs**: Chief Strategist (01), Signal Collector (02), Research Desk (03) MUST be complete.
- **Trigger**: Research Brief is finalized.
- **Output Action**: Save as `current_draft.md`.
- **Next Step**: STOP. Wait for Human Review/Commit. Then Trigger Red Team (09).
- **Prohibitions**: Never auto-send to Platform Adapter. Never auto-publish.
