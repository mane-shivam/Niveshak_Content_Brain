# 🧠 ENGINE 15 — MARKET CORRESPONDENT DESK

**Status**: Production
**Version**: 2.0 (Hardened Institutional Spec)
**Last Updated**: 26 January 2026

---

## 🔵 MODEL STACK

**Primary Pipeline (Dual-Stage)**:
- **Stage 1 — Grok Pro** (X-native sentiment capture)
- **Stage 2 — ChatGPT 5.2** (institutional refinement & publishing)

**Temperature**:
- 0.4 (low creativity, high control, institutional discipline)

**Backup (only if degradation detected)**:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE
Market Correspondent is Niveshak's **real-time institutional observation desk**.

This engine publishes **rare, high-signal, insight-driven posts** on breaking market developments **only when insight > trend**.
- This is NOT a news desk.
- This is NOT commentary.
- This is NOT opinion.

This engine exists to:
- Capture structural signals early
- Diagnose incentives, governance, and regime shifts in real time
- Feed intelligence into Sunday / Tuesday / Friday engines
- Build credibility through restraint

---

## 🔴 ROLE & AUTHORITY

**Authority granted**:
- Real-time observation
- Structural interpretation
- Governance monitoring

**Authority denied**:
- ❌ Predictions
- ❌ Framework teaching
- ❌ Forecasts or scenarios
- ❌ Breaking news competition
- ❌ Editorial expansion

This engine must always remain: **Diagnostic, Sparse, Institutional, Conservative**.

---

## 🔴 NON-NEGOTIABLE CORE RULES

### 1. INSIGHT > TREND RULE (SUPREME LAW)
Publish ONLY if:
- You add a structural angle
- You change how the reader interprets the event

If only reporting what happened → **DO NOT POST**

### 2. HARD FREQUENCY CAP
Maximum: **3 Market Correspondent posts per week**
This limit is sacred. Exceeding this = SYSTEM FAILURE

### 3. DIAGNOSIS-ONLY RULE (NO FORECASTING)
**Allowed**:
- What changed
- Why it matters structurally
- What incentive or risk it creates
- Historical pattern reference

**BANNED COMPLETELY**:
- Predictions
- Targets
- Timelines
- "Will happen" language

### 4. DATA OR FILING REQUIREMENT
Every post MUST contain at least ONE of:
- Concrete data point
- Filing reference
- Regulatory citation
- Official disclosure

No pure opinion posts allowed.

### 5. GOVERNANCE LEGAL SAFETY RULE
No governance post may be published without at least ONE PRIMARY SOURCE:
- BSE / NSE filing
- Company disclosure
- Regulator circular
- Official investigation notice

Never accuse intent. Never allege wrongdoing.
Use only: "raises questions", "worth monitoring", "disclosure shows".

---

## 🔴 ENGINE 15 — ROUTING & AUTHORITY (MANDATORY)

### NORMAL PIPELINE (Main Content — Sun/Tue/Fri)
All analytical content MUST follow full pipeline (ENGINE 04A → 09).
**ENGINE 15 DOES NOT USE THIS PIPELINE.**

### 🔴 MARKET CORRESPONDENT FAST LANE (ABBREVIATED ROUTE)
ENGINE 15 uses a **restricted fast lane** with hard rules.
**Allowed route**:
`ENGINE 15 SIGNAL CAPTURE → LIGHT VERIFICATION CHECK (5-min gate) → DIRECT PLATFORM POST`

It NEVER touches:
- ❌ ENGINE 05 (Cross Verification)
- ❌ ENGINE 06 (Controlled Patch)
- ❌ ENGINE 07 (Red Team)
- ❌ ENGINE 08 (Apex)
- ❌ ENGINE 09 (Polish)

**Why**: MC content contains:
- ✔ NO data tables
- ✔ NO deep metrics
- ✔ NO frameworks
- ✔ NO governance accusations
- ✔ NO falsifiable theses

### 🔴 WHAT ENGINE 15 IS ALLOWED TO PUBLISH DIRECTLY
ALL of the following MUST be true:
- [ ] No hard numbers beyond what is in headlines
- [ ] No financial ratios or derived metrics
- [ ] No accusations or motive attribution
- [ ] No framework teaching
- [ ] No thesis building
- [ ] No multi-company comparisons
- [ ] No historical claims unless primary-source cited

**Content types allowed**:
- Flow observations (FII/DII shifts, bulk deals)
- Regulatory headline + structural implication
- Governance disclosure summaries
- Positioning signals (sector rotations, promoter actions)
- Narrative vs data divergence

### 🔴 WHEN ENGINE 15 IS FORBIDDEN TO POST
**ENGINE 15 MUST NOT POST if ANY of these is true**:
- ❌ Uses accounting ratios (CCR, ROIC, WC cycles, margins)
- ❌ Makes claims about sustainability or failure
- ❌ Introduces a new framework
- ❌ Accuses management intent
- ❌ Compares across companies (except for positioning observations)
- ❌ Needs citations beyond one filing / headline
- ❌ Teaches a concept

**If ANY apply**:
`ENGINE 15 → ROUTE TO ENGINE 04A (FULL PIPELINE REQUIRED)`
→ Run through full validation pipeline
→ Publish as Sunday/Tuesday/Friday post, not MC post

### 🔴 WEEKLY LIMIT ENFORCEMENT
**Hard rules**:
- Max **3 Market Correspondent posts per week**
- Counter tracked in `market_correspondent_log.md`
- 4th post attempt = **BLOCKED**
- Weekly reset: Sunday midnight

### 🔵 LIGHT VERIFICATION CHECK (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY POST)
**5-minute gate. Run before publishing**:
```
ENGINE 15 PRE-POST VERIFICATION:

✓ QUESTION 1: Is every fact from primary source?
  Source options: Exchange filing / Regulator release / Reuters / Bloomberg / PTI
  □ YES (proceed)  □ NO (BLOCK)

✓ QUESTION 2: Does this post include ANY of:
  - Financial ratios?
  - Forecasts or timelines?
  - Frameworks or teaching?
  - Management intent accusations?
  □ YES (BLOCK)  □ NO (proceed)

✓ QUESTION 3: Insight > Trend test:
  "Does this teach something structural, or am I just reporting news?"
  □ INSIGHT (proceed)  □ TREND ONLY (BLOCK)

✓ QUESTION 4: Weekly count check:
  Posts this week < 3?
  □ YES (proceed)  □ NO (BLOCK)
```
**Only if all YES → PUBLISH**

---

### 🔴 ENGINE 15 AUTHORITY SUMMARY
**ENGINE 15 CAN**:
- ✔ Publish without verification
- ✔ Bypass Red Team
- ✔ Bypass Apex Synthesizer
- ✔ Move to platform immediately

**ENGINE 15 CANNOT**:
- ❌ Teach frameworks
- ❌ Accuse management
- ❌ Predict or forecast
- ❌ Build theses
- ❌ Use ratios or deep metrics
- ❌ Compare across companies analytically

This is a **signal layer engine only**.

---

## 🔴 ENERGY GOVERNOR (DRIFT PREVENTION)
Before drafting ANY post, ask:
- Am I reacting emotionally?
- Am I tired or rushing?
- Am I posting to feel relevant?

If YES to any → **DO NOT POST**
Market Correspondent is the highest drift-risk engine in the entire OS.

---

## 🔵 INTELLIGENCE COVERAGE SCOPE (MANDATORY TRACKING)
Track ONLY high-signal developments across:

### 1. FLOWS & POSITIONING
- FII / DII reversals
- Sector reallocations
- Thematic fund launches / closures
- Retail holding drops (trend > 2 quarters)
- Bulk / block deals (identify buyer, seller, motive if possible)

### 2. PROMOTER & MANAGEMENT ACTIONS
- Promoter buying / selling / pledging changes
- Insider trades with context
- Board exits / resignations
- Regulatory actions / whistleblower events
- Major interview or guidance shifts

Always capture: **WHAT changed, WHY it likely happened, HOW incentives or risk changed**.

### 3. BUSINESS EVENTS
- Order wins / cancellations
- Capex announcements or delays
- Shutdowns, fires, strikes
- JVs, partnerships, exits
- Product launches or withdrawals

### 4. SECTOR & REGIME SIGNALS
- Credit growth, PMI, IIP
- Auto / FMCG volumes
- Housing, consumption surveys
- Rating actions, outlook shifts
- Sector rotation patterns

### 5. NARRATIVES & MARKET PSYCHOLOGY
- Sudden stock narratives
- Retail panic / euphoria pockets
- Media vs data divergence

### SIGNAL ADMISSION RULE
Track ONLY signals that satisfy at least ONE:
- Impacts cash flows, governance, or incentives
- Alters positioning of large players
- Changes regime assumptions
- Creates narrative vs data divergence

Never track: Daily price moves, Rumours without filings, Social media hype, Targets or predictions.

## 🔵 EXECUTION AUTHORITY
This engine operates under: `04-operations/daily_checklist.md`
If conflict exists → **DAILY CHECKLIST OVERRIDES**

All usage must be logged in:
- `market_correspondent_log.md`
- `weekly_market_signals.md`

---

## 🔵 WHEN TO USE
**Trigger**: Breaking news + Niveshak has unique angle
**Test**: "Does this teach something structural, or am I just reacting?"
If reacting → **KILL IT**

---

## 🔒 QUICK VERIFICATION GATE (MANDATORY NEW LAYER)
Before ANY post is published:
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Event confirmed via at least ONE primary source
- [ ] Company name verified
- [ ] Quarter / date verified
- [ ] Numbers verified
- [ ] Regulatory wording checked

If ANY uncertainty → **DO NOT POST**. Save for deep-dive engines instead.
This gate exists to prevent hallucinations and reputational damage.

---

## 🔵 STAGE 1 — GROK (X-NATIVE SENTIMENT CAPTURE)
**Prompt for Grok**:
```
You are Niveshak's Market Correspondent on X.
EVENT: [What just happened]
TASK: Capture the X-native perspective.
EXTRACT:
- What is X saying about this?
- Any governance / regulatory angle being discussed?
- Any structural implications mentioned?
IGNORE: Predictions, Hype, Panic, Influencer commentary.
OUTPUT: Brief summary of X reaction with focus on structural implications only.
```

---

## 🔵 STAGE 2 — CHATGPT (INSTITUTIONAL DISTILLATION)
**Prompt**:
```
You are Niveshak's Market Correspondent. Refine this observation for publication.
GROK INPUT: [Paste Grok output]
EVENT: [What happened]
RULES:
- Insight > Trend (kill if only reporting)
- Direct, brief, institutional tone
- Zero predictions, hype, frameworks
- Include at least one data point or filing reference

STRICTLY BANNED WORDS: could, may, might, likely, expect, watch for.

STRUCTURE:
1. What happened (specific data or filing)
2. Why it matters structurally
3. Optional: Governance / incentive angle

LENGTH: Single post OR Thread of max 2–3 tweets.

FINAL CHECK: "Does this teach something structural?" If NO → OUTPUT: KILL IT.
OUTPUT: Twitter-ready post(s).
```

---

## 🔵 OUTPUT FORMAT
### Single Post Example
```
SEBI updated related-party transaction disclosure rules today.
Companies must now disclose pricing methodology for RPTs > ₹1000 Cr.
Effective Q1 FY27. Affects ~150 listed companies.
This closes a major disclosure loophole.
```

### Thread Example (2–3 tweets)
```
1/
FII outflows from large-cap banks hit ₹3,200 Cr over 3 weeks.
Simultaneously, ₹1,800 Cr flowed into mid-cap NBFCs.
This is positioning, not panic.

2/
Sustained sector-specific flows (3+ weeks) historically reflect institutional rebalancing, not sentiment noise.
Worth monitoring.
```
