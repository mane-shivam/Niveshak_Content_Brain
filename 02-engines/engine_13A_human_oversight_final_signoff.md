## ENGINE NAME
**Engine ID**: ENGINE 13.A — HUMAN OVERSIGHT & FINAL SIGN-OFF PROTOCOL
**Status**: CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY — HIGHEST HUMAN CONTROL LAYER
**Position**: Mandatory checkpoint before and after publication

---

## ROLE
**Chief Strategist / Human Editor / Final Arbiter**
This is the only non-AI engine in the system.
It has **absolute kill, hold, and rollback authority**.
No post may be published without passing this engine.

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE
ENGINE 13.A exists to solve one problem permanently:
> Prevent catastrophic publication of wrong, distorted, hallucinated, or insight-destroyed research.

This engine provides:
- Final human judgment
- Constitutional integrity enforcement
- Legal & reputational firewall

- Hallucination detection
- System governance

This is the layer that guarantees:
- AI never silently drifts
- Insights are never corrupted
- Wrong research never ships
- Niveshak’s credibility compounds permanently

---

## 🔒 ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY
This engine has **TOTAL OVERRIDE POWER** over:
- ENGINE 08 (Apex)
- ENGINE 09 (Polish)
- ENGINE 10–12 (Platform Adapters)
- ENGINE 13 (Visuals)

It may:
- Approve publication
- Hold publication
- Kill a post entirely
- Force rollback to any upstream engine
- Suspend any engine
- Log constitutional violations

No AI engine may bypass this layer.

## 🔵 WHEN THIS ENGINE RUNS (THREE MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS)
ENGINE 13.A runs at three fixed stages.

---

### 🔹 CHECKPOINT 1 — POST-APEX CONSTITUTIONAL AUDIT

## 🔵 EMERGENCY ESCALATION MODE
**Trigger if**:
- Public error detected
- Regulator / company complaint
- Viral misinterpretation
- Red Team failure post-publish

**Protocol**:
1. Freeze all distribution
2. Pin correction / takedown
3. Notify Chief Strategist
4. Route to ENGINE 05 + ENGINE 06
5. Log incident in `failure_log.md`

---

## 🔵 WEEKLY OVERSIGHT DUTIES
Every week ENGINE 13.A must review:
- Last 5 sign-offs
- Any hallucination incidents
- Any corrections issued
- Any Red Team overrides

Update:
- `model_health_log.md`
- `framework_performance.md`

---

## 🔵 MONTHLY GOVERNANCE REVIEW
Mandatory monthly audit:
Track:
- Insight preservation rate (target 100%)
- Hallucination incidents (target 0)
- Legal risk incidents (target 0)
- Engine suspensions
- Red Team kill rate

File: `constitutional_health_report.md`

---

## 🔴 SUSPENSION & SANCTIONS
Immediately suspend an engine if:
- Apex modifies protected insight once
- Polish changes a claim
- Platform adapter adds hype twice
- Visual engine publishes wrong data once

ENGINE 13.A has unilateral suspension power.

---

## 🟢 FINAL DESIGN INTENT
ENGINE 13.A guarantees:
- No blind AI publishing
- No silent drift
- No hallucinated research
- No legal disasters
- No credibility loss

This converts your system into:
> **A HUMAN-GOVERNED, AI-ASSISTED INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH DESK**

This is what hedge funds, consultancies, and policy desks run internally.
