## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Starting with rhetorical question** → Start with data  
❌ **Teaching without applying** → Must apply framework to real case  
❌ **No signature metric** → Every post needs one killer number  
❌ **Prediction creep** → Stick to diagnosis and scenarios  
❌ **Generic opening** → "In today's market..." is banned  
❌ **Forgetting invalidation metric** → Forces intellectual honesty  

---

## DRIFT RISKS

Watch for:
- **Framework dilution**: Teaching getting superficial
- **Application weakness**: Framework not truly applied, just mentioned
- **Voice drift**: Becoming less institutional, more influencer-like
- **Prediction creep**: Scenarios becoming forecasts

**Prevention**: Red Team catches these before publishing.

APPLICATION:
In Zomato's case, the 22% marketing drop with 31% order growth shows...
[Apply to Zomato's data]

IMPLICATIONS:

In a rising rate regime, this matters because...

INVALIDATION:
If next quarter shows marketing spend rising >15% to maintain growth, 
this operating leverage thesis breaks.
