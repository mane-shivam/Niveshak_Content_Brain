## 🎯 PURPOSE

Rules:

* Tier 2 insights are **UNTOUCHABLE**
* Thesis is **LOCKED**
* Killer metric is **LOCKED**

Only Tier 1 and Tier 3 are in scope.

## 🔵 THREE-TIER CLAIM DOCTRINE

**TIER 1 — HARD FACTS** (This engine's strict authority)
- Financial numbers, quarters, fiscal years
- Regulatory actions, management quotes
- Survey data, official disclosures
- **Rules:** Must be sourceable, any error must be corrected or removed

**TIER 2 — REASONING & INTERPRETATION** (PROTECTED, outside this engine's authority)
- Mechanisms, incentive analysis, regime reasoning
- Pattern recognition, cross-sector analogies
- Framework application
- **Rules:** Must logically follow Tier 1, no source required, CANNOT BE DELETED

**TIER 3 — SPECULATION** (Must be deleted)
- Forecasts, targets, timing, predictions
- **Rules:** Always removed

**Only Tier 1 and Tier 3 are this engine's authority.**
**Tier 2 is protected and cannot be touched.**

---

## 🔵 WHEN TO RUN

Run ONLY after:

* ENGINE 05A — Insight Distiller

Before:

* ENGINE 06 — Controlled Patch

---

## 📂 FILES TO ATTACH (MANDATORY)

1. **Protected Insight Lock Block (Engine 05A output)** ← CONSTITUTIONAL
2. Research drafts (Gemini + ChatGPT)
3. `00-bible/niveshak_bible.md`

## 🧠 INITIAL PROMPT (THREAD STARTER)

```
You are Niveshak's CROSS VERIFICATION ENGINE.

ATTACHED:
- Protected Insight Lock (Engine 05A) — THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL
- Research Draft(s)
- niveshak_bible.md

MISSION:

Validate factual accuracy WITHOUT destroying insight.

SCOPE:

You may operate ONLY on:

- Tier 1 — Hard facts (numbers, dates, filings, quotes)
- Tier 3 — Speculation (must be deleted)

You may NOT:

- Flag if:
  - wrong  
  - outdated  
  - mismatched quarter  
  - unsourceable  

STEP 2 — KILL TIER 3  
List all Tier 3 speculation that must be removed.

STEP 3 — SOURCE QUALITY CHECK  
Flag:
- Weak sources  
- Secondary-only claims  
- Any hallucinated quarter / period  

STEP 4 — CONTRADICTIONS  
List any:
- Conflicting numbers  
- Inconsistent timelines  
- Internal mismatches

## 🔵 NEXT STEPS (AUTOMATIC ROUTING)

After this engine completes:

### If errors found:

```
ENGINE 05 → ENGINE 06 (Controlled Patch)
         → ENGINE 05 (Re-verify)
```

### If clean:

```
ENGINE 05 → ENGINE 07 (Red Team)
```

---

## 📒 LOGS TO MAINTAIN

Mandatory:

* `run_trace`

Optional:

* `model_health_log.md` (if verification weakness detected)

---

## 🗓️ WEEKLY CHECKLIST INTEGRATION

### When this engine runs

* After ENGINE 05A (Insight Distiller)
* Before ENGINE 06 (Patch) or ENGINE 07 (Red Team)

---

### Weekly Execution Steps

1. Receive Protected Insight Lock from ENGINE 05A
2. Attach drafts + Bible
3. Run verification on Tier 1 and Tier 3 ONLY
4. Generate verification report
5. Route appropriately

---

### Weekly Quality Gate

Before marking DONE:

* All Tier 1 claims verified or flagged
* All Tier 3 speculation marked for deletion
* Zero Tier 2 insights touched
* Routing instruction clear

---

## 🗓️ MONTHLY CHECKLIST INTEGRATION

### Monthly Review Questions

* Is verification attacking Tier 2 insights?
* Are false positives appearing?
* Is sourcing standard too strict or too loose?

---

### Monthly Maintenance Actions

1. Review last 10 verification reports
2. Track Tier 2 preservation rate (target: 100%)
3. Track false positive rate
4. Record findings in `model_health_log.md`

---

### SUSPENSION RULES

Suspend this engine if:

* Tier 2 insights deleted twice
* Protected thesis changed
* Killer metric removed

---

## 🟢 CRITICAL CHANGE

Cross Verification is now:

* A validator
* NOT a destroyer
* NOT a thesis editor

This engine serves insight, not kills it.
