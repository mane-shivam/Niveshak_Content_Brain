# 🧠 NIVESHAK CONTENT INTELLIGENCE REPOSITORY

**Version 1.0** | **Status**: Production | **Last Updated**: 21 January 2026

---

## 🎯 WHAT THIS IS

This is not a content repo.  
This is not a documentation repo.  
This is **a living institutional operating system** for producing elite, forensic, regime-aware equity research.

**Niveshak** is India's most disciplined equity intelligence platform. We publish institutional-grade research for serious retail investors, HNIs, fund managers, and critics who reject hype and demand rigor.

This repository encodes:
- **12 coordinated AI engines** working in harmony (multi-model validation, replaceable by design)
- **Complete philosophical framework** (voice, bans, principles, legal guardrails)
- **Daily/weekly/monthly rituals** for consistent quality
- **Validation layers** preventing drift and errors
- **Memory systems** ensuring frameworks compound, not fade (including thesis evolution tracking)
- **Failure recovery protocols** maintaining honesty and trust
- **Weekly synthesis engine** condensing insights into actionable intelligence

---

## ⚡ QUICK START

**If you're new to this system, read these 3 files in order:**

1. **[`00-bible/niveshak_bible.md`](00-bible/niveshak_bible.md)** — The Constitution  
   Our mission, voice rules, writing bans, edge dimensions, philosophy

2. **[`01-master/niveshak_operating_system_v1.md`](01-master/niveshak_operating_system_v1.md)** — The Operating System  
   Complete overview of all 12 engines, model stack, rituals, quality gates

3. **[`04-operations/daily_checklist.md`](04-operations/daily_checklist.md)** — The Execution Authority  
   Day-by-day guide with exact prompts, files, and outputs

**That's it. Those 3 files contain the entire system.**

---

## ⚙️ EXECUTION HIERARCHY

**Authority flows in this order:**

1. **`daily_checklist.md`** = **Execution Law** (highest authority)
2. **`niveshak_bible.md`** = **Philosophy** (voice, principles, bans)
3. **`niveshak_operating_system_v1.md`** = **Architecture** (how engines work)
4. **Individual engine files** = **Specifications** (detailed prompts)

**Critical Rule**: If any document conflicts with `daily_checklist.md`, the checklist wins.  
This prevents drift when documentation evolves at different speeds.

**New Operator Safety**: New team members require Chief Editor approval for all publications during first 4 weeks.

---

## 🔐 CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Teaching Before Reacting
We educate first, comment second. Frameworks compound over time.

### 2. Diagnosis > Prediction
- **80%** Diagnosis (what happened and why)
- **20%** Scenario (if X then Y)
- **0%** Prediction (what will happen)

### 3. Institutional Voice, Zero Hype
Sharp, calm, forensic, anti-fluff. We maintain credibility over clicks.

### 4. Framework Reinforcement
We don't just introduce frameworks—we reinforce them over time for compounding intellectual value.

### 5. Governance & Legal Discipline
We question incentives and management behavior with data, never sensationally.
**Legal Rule**: All allegations framed as data-based observations, not intent-based accusations. Avoid fraud implications unless officially disclosed by regulators.

### 6. Quality Over Speed
Better to kill a mediocre idea than publish it and damage trust.

### 7. Model Governance Philosophy
**Multi-Model Validation**: No single AI model is gospel. We use multiple models for cross-validation.
**Models Are Replaceable**: If any model degrades, we swap it. The system survives model failure.
**Weekly Health Checks**: Every engine monitored for hallucinations, tone drift, and logic errors.

## 🛡️ QUALITY SYSTEMS

### Pre-Publication Gates (ALL 10 must pass)
1. **Signature Metric**: One killer number anchors the post
2. **2+ Edge Dimensions**: Novel metric / Regime / Governance / Teaching / Cross-sector / Product
3. **Invalidation Metric**: Specific data point that would prove analysis wrong
4. **Coffee Test**: Would a smart friend feel smarter hearing this?
5. **Voice Check**: Zero banned AI tells
6. **Red Team Approval**: Adversarial challenge passed
7. **Energy Governor**: Post NOT written when fatigued
8. **Data Verification**: All killer numbers cross-verified from 2 independent sources
9. **Prediction Leakage Scan**: Zero price targets, directional claims, or implied returns
10. **Publication Authorization Gate**: Final institutional accountability check before scheduling

### Drift Prevention
- **Weekly**: Framework reinforcement audit
- **Monthly**: Voice drift check (random post sampling), prediction leakage audit, model health review
- **Continuous**: Post Index tracks patterns

### Intellectual Memory Systems
- **Framework Performance**: Win/loss tracking for every framework application
- **Thesis Evolution**: Version control for core theses showing how thinking evolved over time

### Failure Recovery
- **Acknowledge** within 24 hours
- **Investigate** within 48 hours
- **Correct publicly** within 72 hours
- **Extract learning** and update systems
- **Log everything** in failure_log.md

2. Promise guaranteed returns
3. Hype companies for clicks
4. Copy consensus research
5. Use AI-generated content unedited

7. Sacrifice honesty for engagement
8. Publish content we wouldn't read ourselves

---

## ✅ WHAT NIVESHAK ALWAYS DOES

1. Teach frameworks that compound
2. Show our work and reasoning
3. Acknowledge what we don't know
4. Update when we're wrong
5. Question incentives when data warrants
6. Write in calm, institutional voice
7. Reference specific companies and metrics
8. Test every post against Coffee Test
9. Maintain 2-Edge minimum
10. Reinforce frameworks over time
