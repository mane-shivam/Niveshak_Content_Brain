**Purpose**: Adapt Niveshak content for Twitter while preserving institutional voice

---

## STRUCTURE

### Thread Length
- **Minimum**: 5 tweets
- **Maximum**: 12 tweets
- **Sweet Spot**: 7-9 tweets

### Thread Flow
1. **Hook Tweet**: Signature metric or surprising contrast
2. **Context** (1-2 tweets): Why this matters
3. **Core Analysis** (3-5 tweets): Framework application
4. **Invalidation/Conclusion** (1 tweet): What would prove this wrong
5. **CTA** (1 tweet): Engagement question or newsletter/profile link

## TONE RULES

**Maintain**:
- Institutional voice (sharp, calm, data-driven)
- Zero hype
- Specific numbers, not vague claims

**Adapt**:
- Shorter sentences
- More punchy
- One idea per tweet

**Banned on Twitter** (same as everywhere):
- "Let's dive in"
- "Thread 🧵"  (just start, don't announce)
- Emoji overuse (max 1-2 per thread, only for clarity)
- Prediction language

## HOOK FORMULAS

**Good Opening Tweets**:
```
Zomato's marketing spend dropped 22% YoY.

Orders grew 31%.

This isn't luck—it's operating leverage at work.
```

```
Swiggy reported record revenue.

Free cash flow? Negative for the fifth straight quarter.

Here's why this matters.
```

**Bad Opening Tweets**:
❌ "Let's talk about Zomato 🧵"
❌ "You won't believe what I found..."
❌ "Is the bull market over?"
