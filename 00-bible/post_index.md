# 📰 POST INDEX

## 🎯 TRACKING CRITICAL ELEMENTS

### Frameworks
Every post should reference this field:
- **Existing Framework** — Name the framework from `frameworks_index.md`
- **New Framework** — Mark as "New: [Framework Name]" and add to frameworks index
- **None (Teaching)** — Pure educational content without applied framework
- **None (Market Observation)** — Real-time commentary, not framework-driven

### Signature Metric
The **one killer number** that makes the post memorable.  
Examples:
- "22% YoY marketing spend drop despite 31% order growth"
- "Promoter pledging rose from 15% to 48% in two quarters"
- "Free cash flow negative for fifth straight quarter despite revenue growth"

### Governance Angle
Track if/how we questioned governance:
- **None** — Pure operational/financial analysis
- **Soft** — Raised questions about disclosure quality or related-party transactions
- **Medium** — Highlighted concerning patterns (pledging, board changes)
- **Hard** — Direct skepticism about management incentives (rare, evidence-based only)

### Invalidation Metric
What data point or event would prove our analysis wrong?  
Examples:
- "If next quarter shows margin expansion despite volume drop"
- "If promoter pledging decreases below 30% next quarter"
- "If company discloses clear rationale for related-party transaction spike"

**Why This Matters:** Forces intellectual honesty and prevents unfalsifiable analysis.

## 📈 PERFORMANCE TRACKING

For each post, log:

### Quantitative Metrics
- **LinkedIn:** Impressions, Engagement Rate, Comments, Shares
- **Twitter:** Impressions, Engagement Rate, Replies, Retweets
- **Reddit:** Upvotes, Comments, Cross-posts

### Qualitative Signals
- **High-Signal Comments** — Thoughtful questions, challenges, or extensions of the framework
- **Request for More** — Readers asking for framework application to other companies
- **Framework Callbacks** — Readers referencing this post in future discussions
- **Critical Engagement** — Smart disagreements or contrarian views (these are valuable)

### Red Flags
- **Low engagement despite quality** — May indicate topic selection issue
- **High engagement, low substance** — May indicate we're trending toward hype (dangerous)
- **No questions or discussion** — May indicate we're not provocative enough or too obvious

## 🚨 DRIFT DETECTION PROTOCOLS

### Weekly Check (Every Saturday)
Review last 4 posts to ensure:
- [ ] All posts hit at least 2 Niveshak Edge dimensions
- [ ] No banned AI tells appear
- [ ] Signature metrics are present and strong
- [ ] Frameworks are being reinforced, not just introduced and forgotten
- [ ] Governance angle is appropriate (not absent for 4+ weeks, not excessive)

### Monthly Audit (First Saturday of Month)
Conduct comprehensive review:

**Voice Drift Check:**
- Read 3 random posts from the month
- Apply Coffee Test to each
- Check for AI tell creep
- Verify institutional tone maintained

**Framework Drift Check:**
- Cross-reference with `frameworks_index.md`
- Are we introducing too many new frameworks without reinforcing old ones?
- Are framework applications getting sloppier?

**Redundancy Check:**
- Are we analyzing the same companies repeatedly without new angles?
- Are signature metrics becoming repetitive?
- Are we teaching the same concepts without adding depth?

**Quality Drift Check:**
- Are invalidation metrics present in all analytical posts?
- Are governance angles evidence-based or speculative?
- Are we maintaining 80% diagnosis / 20% scenario / 0% prediction?
