# 📚 FRAMEWORKS INDEX

**Version 1.0 | Living Document**

This index tracks every proprietary framework introduced by Niveshak. It serves three critical functions:

1. **Memory System** — Ensures frameworks compound over time rather than being forgotten
2. **Reinforcement Tracker** — Flags frameworks that haven't been used recently
3. **Performance Ledger** — Documents which frameworks resonate with audiences

## 📋 FRAMEWORK TRACKING SCHEMA

| Framework | First Introduced | Core Metric | Description | Last Reinforced | Performance | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| _Example: Operating Leverage Asymmetry_ | _15 Jan 2026_ | _Operating Leverage Ratio_ | _Operating leverage amplifies both growth and decline—most investors only consider upside_ | _15 Jan 2026_ | _High engagement_ | _Use in volatile sectors_ |

## 🎯 FRAMEWORK CATEGORIES

Frameworks should fall into these categories:

### 1. **Metric Frameworks**
Proprietary metrics or novel ways to interpret standard metrics.  
*Examples: GMV vs. Revenue divergence, ESOP dilution velocity, Working capital cycle compression*

### 2. **Regime Frameworks**
Mental models for understanding how market/policy regimes shape outcomes.  
*Examples: Rate regime impact on asset-light models, Liquidity regime vs. quality premium*

### 3. **Governance Frameworks**
Patterns for evaluating management quality and incentive alignment.  
*Examples: Pledging velocity as stress signal, Related-party transaction growth analysis*

### 4. **Sector-Specific Frameworks**
Industry-specific lenses for evaluating business models.  
*Examples: Food delivery unit economics, D2C customer acquisition cost efficiency*

### 5. **Cross-Sector Pattern Frameworks**
Universal patterns that repeat across industries.  
*Examples: Subsidy-to-dominance playbook, Platform economics at scale*

## ⚠️ REINFORCEMENT RULES

### Weekly Check (Every Saturday)
- Review all frameworks
- Flag any framework not reinforced in **4+ weeks**
- Schedule reinforcement in upcoming content

### Monthly Audit (First Saturday of Month)
- Evaluate performance of all frameworks
- Identify frameworks that aren't resonating
- Consider retiring or refining weak frameworks
- Document learnings in Notes column

### Reinforcement Methods
1. **Direct Application** — Use framework to analyze a current company/event
2. **Teaching Post** — Dedicate content to explaining and deepening the framework
3. **Callback Reference** — Mention in passing while analyzing something else ("As we showed in our Operating Leverage framework...")
4. **Cross-Framework Integration** — Combine two frameworks for richer analysis

---

## 📈 PERFORMANCE TRACKING

Track engagement for each framework:

**High Performance Indicators:**
- Comments asking for more examples
- Social shares specifically mentioning the framework
- Reader questions that reference the framework
- Requests to apply framework to other companies

**Medium Performance Indicators:**
- Standard engagement (likes, shares)
- Occasional mentions in comments

**Low Performance Indicators:**
- No reader interaction
- No callback opportunities
- Framework feels forced when applied

---

## 🔄 UPDATE PROTOCOL

### After Every Post
1. If a framework was used, update "Last Reinforced" date
2. Add any new performance observations to Notes
3. If new framework was introduced, add complete entry

### Weekly (Every Saturday)
1. Review entire index
2. Flag frameworks not reinforced in 4+ weeks with ⚠️
3. Plan reinforcement for flagged frameworks

### Monthly (First Saturday)
1. Conduct performance audit
2. Update Performance column for all frameworks
3. Write summary of top 3 performing frameworks
4. Consider retiring frameworks with consistent low performance

---

## 🗑️ FRAMEWORK RETIREMENT

Frameworks can be retired if:
- Consistently low engagement for 3+ months
- Framework becomes obsolete due to market changes
- Better framework replaces it
- Initial hypothesis was proven wrong

**Retirement Process:**
1. Document reason in Notes
2. Move to "Retired Frameworks" section below
3. Keep for institutional memory
4. Never delete (we learn from what didn't work)

---

## 🪦 RETIRED FRAMEWORKS

| Framework | Introduced | Retired | Reason for Retirement |
|-----------|------------|---------|----------------------|
| _Example_ | _Date_ | _Date_ | _Why it no longer works_ |

---

## 💡 FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE

Ideas for future frameworks (not yet fully developed):

| Idea | Category | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| _Example: Cash conversion quality score_ | _Metric_ | _Research phase_ | _Need to backtest on 20+ companies_ |

## 🎓 FRAMEWORK COMPOUNDING STRATEGY

**Goal:** Build an interconnected web of frameworks that reference and reinforce each other.

**How:**
1. **Layering** — When introducing Framework B, reference Framework A if related
2. **Integration** — Combine frameworks for multi-dimensional analysis
3. **Evolution** — Refine frameworks as we learn (document changes in Notes)
4. **Teaching** — Create dedicated posts that go deep on high-performing frameworks

**Example of Compounding:**
> "In our Operating Leverage framework, we showed how margin expansion accelerates in growth phases. Now apply that to the Regime Framework: in a high-rate regime, companies with negative operating leverage face compounding pressure."

## 📝 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHIEF STRATEGIST

When planning content:
1. Check this index weekly
2. Prioritize frameworks with ⚠️ (not reinforced in 4+ weeks)
3. Look for opportunities to integrate multiple frameworks
4. Suggest new frameworks based on market observations
5. Flag underperforming frameworks for review

---

## 📝 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHIEF EDITOR

During monthly drift audits:
1. Verify this index is up to date
2. Check that high-performing frameworks are being leveraged
3. Ensure new posts aren't redundant with existing frameworks
4. Validate that frameworks are being applied correctly (not drifting from original intent)
