# 🗑️ KILLED IDEAS LOG

**Version 1.0 | Idea Cemetery**

This document logs every content idea that was killed during the **Idea Kill Zone** ritual or during quality gates. It serves three critical purposes:

1. **Pattern Recognition** — Identify which types of ideas consistently fail quality checks
2. **Rule Reinforcement** — Document which Niveshak rules are being violated most often
3. **Learning System** — Ensure we learn from rejected ideas and don't repeat mistakes

## 📋 KILLED IDEAS SCHEMA

| Date | Idea | Why Killed | Rule Violated | Lesson |
|------|------|------------|---------------|--------|
| _16 Jan 2026_ | _"5 Stocks to Watch This Week"_ | _Listicle format, no framework, prediction-heavy_ | _Bible: No listicles, No predictions_ | _Focus on teaching, not tips_ |

---

## 🚫 KILL CATEGORIES

Ideas are killed for these primary reasons:

### 1. **Voice/Philosophy Violations**
- Contains AI tells or banned phrases
- Too hype-driven or sensationalist
- Lacks institutional tone
- Fails Coffee Test

### 2. **Framework Violations**
- Doesn't hit 2+ Niveshak Edge dimensions
- No signature metric
- Prediction-heavy instead of diagnosis
- Redundant with existing frameworks

### 3. **Quality Violations**
- No killer opening sentence
- Lacks invalidation metric
- Weak governance angle when it should have one
- Too generic or obvious (not novel enough)

### 4. **Strategic Violations**
- Wrong timing (e.g., doesn't align with market regime)
- Platform mismatch (e.g., too technical for Twitter)
- Resource constraints (can't research adequately in time)

### 5. **Redundancy Violations**
- Too similar to recent post
- Framework already thoroughly covered
- Same company analyzed without new angle

## 💡 IDEA KILL ZONE RITUAL (Reference)

**When:** Every Sunday 9:00pm–9:30pm  
**Purpose:** Kill weak ideas before investing time in research  
**Process:**
1. Chief Strategist proposes 3-5 ideas for the week
2. Each idea evaluated against:
   - Does it pass Coffee Test in concept form?
   - Can it hit 2+ Niveshak Edge dimensions?
   - Is there a clear signature metric?
   - Is it novel (not redundant)?
   - Do we have capacity to research it properly?
3. Ideas that fail any check are killed and logged here
4. Surviving ideas proceed to research phase

## 🎓 LEARNING EXTRACTION

### Quarterly Pattern Analysis
Every quarter, analyze all kills to extract meta-lessons:

**Q1 2026 Learnings:**
- [Pattern discovered]
- [Adjustment made to system]
- [Rule reinforcement needed]

**Example Learning:**
> "Killed 5 ideas in January for being too prediction-heavy. Pattern: Signal Collector was flagging 'market reaction' stories. Adjustment: Updated Signal Collector prompt to prioritize structural changes over daily market moves."

---

## 📝 INSTRUCTIONS FOR IDEA KILL ZONE

During Sunday ritual:
1. Propose each idea against kill criteria
2. Document kill decisions immediately in this log
3. Extract lesson from each kill
4. Update Signal Collector or Chief Strategist prompts if pattern emerges

---

## 📝 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHIEF EDITOR

During monthly drift audit:
1. Review all killed ideas from the month
2. Identify kill patterns
3. Check if rules are being violated repeatedly (indicates system drift)
4. Update engine prompts if specific engine has high kill rate
5. Extract quarterly learnings

---

## 🎯 HEALTHY KILL RATE

**Target: 30-50% of proposed ideas should be killed**

**Why:**
- Too low (< 20%) = We're not being selective enough, quality may suffer
- Too high (> 60%) = Ideation engines need better calibration
- Sweet spot (30-50%) = Rigorous selection maintaining high bar

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS

Watch for these warning patterns:

**Same Ideas Repeatedly Proposed:**
- Indicates engine memory failure
- Cross-reference with Post Index
- Update engine restart prompts

**Same Rules Repeatedly Violated:**
- Indicates engine drift
- Requires prompt refinement
- May need Bible reinforcement in engine context

**Zero Kills for 2+ Weeks:**
- Indicates we may be lowering standards
- Trigger quality audit
- Review recent publications for drift

---

## 💾 ARCHIVE PROTOCOL

After 100 entries, move older kills to:
- `killed_ideas_2026_archive.md`
- `killed_ideas_2027_archive.md`

Keep most recent 50 in this main file.
