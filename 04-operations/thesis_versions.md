## EXAMPLE: Operating Leverage Thesis

**Version**: v2.1  
**First Introduced**: 15 Jan 2026  
**Last Updated**: 28 Jan 2026  
**Status**: Active

**v1.0** — 15 Jan 2026:
- **Original Claim**: Zomato reaching operating leverage inflection (marketing spend ↓, orders ↑)
- **Evidence**: Q3 FY26 data: Marketing -22% YoY, Orders +31%
- **Context**: Platform maturity hypothesis

**v1.1** — 21 Jan 2026:
- **What Changed**: Swiggy Q3 showed opposite pattern (marketing ↑, burn continues)
- **Refinement**: Operating leverage is winner-specific, not sector-wide
- **What Held**: Zomato thesis intact
- **What Failed**: Assumed sector-wide pattern

**v2.0** — 28 Jan 2026:
- **Major Revision**: Operating leverage framework now requires "critical mass test"
- **New Evidence**: Historical data from 8 quarters confirms threshold effect
- **Current Stance**: Operating leverage real but non-linear; requires dominance metrics

**Purpose of This Log**:
This captures **HOW Niveshak's thinking evolved**, not just WHAT we published.

Over time, this becomes:
- IP moat (nobody else tracks thesis evolution)
- Learning system (see patterns in what breaks)
- Onboarding goldmine (new members see reasoning trajectory)
