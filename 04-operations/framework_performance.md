# 📊 FRAMEWORK PERFORMANCE

**Purpose**: Track which frameworks succeed, fail, or need retirement

---

## PERFORMANCE TRACKING SCHEMA

| Framework Name | Introduced | Total Uses | Last Used | Status | Win Rate | Notes |
|----------------|------------|------------|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| _Example: Operating Leverage_ | _15 Jan 2026_ | _3_ | _20 Jan_ | _STRONG_ | _100%_ | _All applications validated by reality_ |

---

## STATUS DEFINITIONS

**STRONG**: Framework applications consistently validated by market reality  
**WEAK**: Some applications fail; thesis has holes  
**FAILED**: Framework broken by market events; needs retirement  
**UNTESTED**: Too new to evaluate (<3 uses)

---

## WIN RATE CALCULATION

**Win** = Framework thesis held up; no contradiction from market/data  
**Loss** = Framework thesis broken; had to issue correction or thesis invalidated  
**Neutral** = Framework used for teaching only (no testable thesis)

**Win Rate** = Wins / (Wins + Losses) × 100%

**Target**: >80% win rate to stay STRONG

---

## FAILURE TRACKING

### Framework #: [Framework Name]

**Date Applied**: [DD MMM YYYY]  
**Thesis**: [Brief description of what framework predicted/diagnosed]  
**Invalidation Metric**: [What would prove it wrong]  
**Actual Outcome**: [What happened]  
**Result**: [Win / Loss / Neutral]  
**Learning**: [What we learned from this application]

---

## RETIREMENT CRITERIA

**Retire Framework If**:
- Win rate <50% over >10 uses
- Systematically broken by market regime change
- Better replacement framework developed
- No reinforcement possible for 6+ months (topic became irrelevant)

**Retirement Process**:
1. Document failure pattern
2. Extract learning
3. Update frameworks_index.md status to RETIRED
4. Remove from active prompts
5. Archive in retired_frameworks.md

## MONTHLY REVIEW TEMPLATE

**Month**: [MMM YYYY]

**New Frameworks Introduced**: [Count + List]  
**Frameworks Reinforced**: [Count + List]  
**Frameworks Tested**: [Count + List]  
**Wins**: [Count]  
**Losses**: [Count]  
**Overall Win Rate**: [X%]

**Status Changes**:

## QUARTERLY FRAMEWORK AUDIT

**Quarter**: Q[X] 2026

**Most Used Frameworks** (Top 5):
1. [Framework] — [Uses] — [Win Rate]
2. [Framework] — [Uses] — [Win Rate]
3. [Framework] — [Uses] — [Win Rate]
4. [Framework] — [Uses] — [Win Rate]
5. [Framework] — [Uses] — [Win Rate]

**Highest Win Rate** (Min 5 uses):
1. [Framework] — [Win Rate]

**Lowest Win Rate** (Red flag):
1. [Framework] — [Win Rate] → Investigate

**Frameworks Not Used in 3+ Months**:
- [Framework] → Plan reinforcement or retire
