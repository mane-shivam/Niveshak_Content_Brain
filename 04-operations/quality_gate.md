# 🔍 QUALITY GATE

**Pre-Publication Checklist — MANDATORY for ALL analytical content**

Every post must pass ALL gates before publishing. No exceptions.

---

## ✅ GATE 1: SIGNATURE METRIC

**Rule**: One killer number anchors the post

**Check**:
- [ ] Is there ONE specific number that's memorable?
- [ ] Would someone remember this number in a conversation?

**Good Examples**:
- "Marketing spend down 22% YoY while orders up 31%"
- "Free cash flow negative for fifth straight quarter"

**Bad Examples**:
- "Revenue grew" ❌ (not specific)
- "Strong performance" ❌ (no number)

---

## ✅ GATE 2: NIVESHAK EDGE (2+ Dimensions)

**Rule**: Must hit at least 2 of 5+1 dimensions

**Dimensions**:
1. Novel metric design
2. Regime diagnosis
3. Governance lens
4. Teaching while analyzing
5. Cross-sector pattern recognition
6. Product integration

**Check**: Mark which 2+ apply to this post

---

## ✅ GATE 3: INVALIDATION METRIC

**Rule**: Clear, specific data point that would prove analysis wrong

**Check**:
- [ ] Is it specific? (Not "if things change")
- [ ] Is it falsifiable? (Can be proven wrong with data)
- [ ] Could we wiggle out of it? (If yes, it's too vague)

**Good**: "If next quarter shows margin expansion despite volume drop, this operating leverage thesis is wrong"

**Bad**: "If market conditions change" ❌

---

## ✅ GATE 4: COFFEE TEST

**Question**: Would a smart friend feel smarter after hearing this?

**Check**:
- [ ] Did I learn something?
- [ ] Would I want to discuss this?
- [ ] Am I grateful this was shared?

If any is "No" → REWRITE or KILL

---

## ✅ GATE 5: VOICE CHECK

**Rule**: Zero banned AI tells, institutional tone maintained

**Banned Phrases** (must be ZERO):
- "It's worth noting"
- "Interestingly" / "Notably"
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's unpack"
- "In today's landscape"
- "This underscores"
- "Testament to"

**Check**: Ctrl+F search each banned phrase. Count must be 0.

---

## ✅ GATE 6: RED TEAM APPROVAL

**Rule**: Red Team must approve before publishing

**Check**:
- [ ] Red Team report completed?
- [ ] Verdict was PUBLISH (not REWRITE or KILL)?
- [ ] All critical issues addressed?
- [ ] Legal/defamation risks checked (allegations framed as data-based, not intent-based)?

---

## ✅ GATE 7: ENERGY GOVERNOR

**Rule**: Post NOT written when mental clarity < threshold

**Check**:
- [ ] Energy & Clarity Check passed before starting draft?
- [ ] If check failed, was writing postponed (not forced)?

**Purpose**: Prevents fatigued writing that damages quality

---

## ✅ GATE 8: DATA VERIFICATION

**Rule**: All killer numbers cross-verified from 2 independent sources

**Check**:
- [ ] Every number verified from 2+ sources (filings + presentation, or presentation + earnings call)?
- [ ] Units confirmed (₹ Cr vs ₹ Mn)?
- [ ] Quarter and FY confirmed?
- [ ] YoY/QoQ calculations verified?

**If unverified**: Mark as APPROX or remove from thesis

---

## ✅ GATE 9: PREDICTION LEAKAGE SCAN

**Rule**: Zero price targets, directional claims, or implied returns

**Banned Language**:
- Price targets ("Will reach ₹500")
- Directional claims ("Set to outperform", "Likely to rise")
- Implied returns ("Good time to buy")
- "Will" language (use "If...then" conditionals instead)

**Check**: Scan for all prediction language. Must be ZERO.

---

## ✅ GATE 10: FINAL HUMAN SANITY PASS

**Rule**: Read once aloud before publishing

**Check**:
- [ ] Read entire post aloud
- [ ] Any sentence feels defensive → rewrite
- [ ] Any sentence feels promotional → rewrite
- [ ] Any sentence feels predictive → rewrite
- [ ] Internal contradictions → fix
- [ ] Tone misalignment → adjust

**Purpose**: Catch what AI misses (overconfidence, subtle hype, logic errors)

---

## 🎯 DECISION MATRIX

| Gates Passed | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| All 10 | ✅ PUBLISH |
| 8-9/10 | ⚠️ REWRITE (fix the failing gates) |
| 7/10 or less | 🛑 KILL (fundamental issues) |
