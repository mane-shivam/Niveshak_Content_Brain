# 🔍 QUALITY GATE

**Pre-Publication Checklist — MANDATORY for ALL analytical content**

Every post must pass ALL gates before publishing. No exceptions.

---

## ✅ GATE 1: SIGNATURE METRIC

**Rule**: One killer number anchors the post

**Check**:
- [ ] Is there ONE specific number that's memorable?
- [ ] Would someone remember this number in a conversation?

**Good Examples**:
- "Marketing spend down 22% YoY while orders up 31%"
- "Free cash flow negative for fifth straight quarter"

**Bad Examples**:
- "Revenue grew" ❌ (not specific)
- "Strong performance" ❌ (no number)

## ✅ GATE 2: NIVESHAK EDGE (2+ Dimensions)

**Rule**: Must hit at least 2 of 5+1 dimensions

**Dimensions**:
1. Novel metric design
2. Regime diagnosis
3. Governance lens
4. Teaching while analyzing
5. Cross-sector pattern recognition
6. Product integration

**Check**: Mark which 2+ apply to this post

---

## ✅ GATE 3: INVALIDATION METRIC

**Rule**: Clear, specific data point that would prove analysis wrong

**Check**:
- [ ] Is it specific? (Not "if things change")
- [ ] Is it falsifiable? (Can be proven wrong with data)
- [ ] Could we wiggle out of it? (If yes, it's too vague)

**Good**: "If next quarter shows margin expansion despite volume drop, this operating leverage thesis is wrong"

**Bad**: "If market conditions change" ❌

---

## ✅ GATE 4: COFFEE TEST

**Question**: Would a smart friend feel smarter after hearing this?

**Check**:
- [ ] Did I learn something?
- [ ] Would I want to discuss this?
- [ ] Am I grateful this was shared?

If any is "No" → REWRITE or KILL

---

## ✅ GATE 5: VOICE CHECK

**Rule**: Zero banned AI tells, institutional tone maintained

**Banned Phrases** (must be ZERO):
- "It's worth noting"
- "Interestingly" / "Notably"
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's unpack"
-"In today's landscape"
- "This underscores"
- "Testament to"

**Check**: Ctrl+F search each banned phrase. Count must be 0.

---

## ✅ GATE 6: RED TEAM APPROVAL

**Rule**: Red Team must approve before publishing

**Check**:
- [ ] Red Team report completed?
- [ ] Verdict was PUBLISH (not REWRITE or KILL)?
- [ ] All critical issues addressed?

---

## 🎯 DECISION MATRIX

| Gates Passed | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| All 6 | ✅ PUBLISH |
| 5/6 | ⚠️ REWRITE (fix the failing gate) |
| 4/6 or less | 🛑 KILL (fundamental issues) |
