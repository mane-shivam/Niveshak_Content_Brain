# 📅 NIVESHAK DAILY CHECKLIST

**Version 1.0 | The Operational Playbook**

This file alone should enable anyone to run Niveshak without external documentation. Every engine, every ritual, every file to attach, every output expected.

---

## 🔵 SUNDAY | 9:00PM – 12:00AM

### 9:00PM–9:30PM: ENERGY & CLARITY CHECK

**Purpose**: Never force mediocre output

**Process**:
1. Ask yourself: "Do I have energy and clarity for quality work tonight?"
2. If NO → Reschedule to Monday, don't compromise quality
3. If YES → Proceed to Idea Kill Zone

**No engine needed** — Personal check

---

### 9:30PM–10:00PM: IDEA KILL ZONE

**Engine**: Chief Strategist (ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking)

**Files to Open**:
- `02-engines/engine_01_chief_strategist.md`
- `00-bible/niveshak_bible.md`
- `00-bible/frameworks_index.md`
- `00-bible/post_index.md`

**Prompt** (to ChatGPT):
```
You are Niveshak's Chief Strategist. Sunday Idea Kill Zone.

TASK: Propose 3-5 content ideas for this week and ruthlessly evaluate each.

ATTACHED:
- niveshak_bible.md (philosophy/voice)
- frameworks_index.md (check what needs reinforcement)
- post_index.md (avoid redundancy)

For each idea evaluate:
- Signature metric (one killer number)
- Edge dimensions (must hit 2+)
- Framework (existing to reinforce or new to introduce)
- Coffee Test (would friend feel smarter?)
- Redundancy (check last 10 posts)
- Verdict: PROCEED / REFRAME / KILL

Be ruthless. 30-50% kill rate is healthy.
```

**Expected Output**: 3-5 ideas with verdicts

**Post-Run Actions**:
- Log KILLED ideas in `00-bible/killed_ideas.md`
- Select 1-2 PROCEED ideas for this week
- Note which frameworks need reinforcement
