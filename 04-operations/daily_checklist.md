# 📅 NIVESHAK DAILY CHECKLIST

**Version 1.1 | The Operational Playbook**

---

## ⚠️ EXECUTION AUTHORITY NOTICE

**This file is the single source of execution truth for Niveshak.**

If any instruction in:
- `README.md`
- `niveshak_operating_system_v1.md`
- Any engine file
- Any other document

conflicts with this checklist:

**→ THIS FILE OVERRIDES ALL OTHERS.**

No exceptions.

---

## 👤 NEW OPERATOR RULE

Before running this checklist for the first time:

1. Read `00-bible/niveshak_bible.md` completely
2. Read this file twice (once to understand, once to internalize)
3. Read `02-engines/engine_01_chief_strategist.md` (controls worldview)

Only then begin execution.

---

## ⏰ DRAFTING WINDOW RULE

**Primary writing window**: Evenings (post-9pm)  
**Daytime sessions**: Research and signal collection only  
**No drafting during daytime** unless urgent earnings require immediate response

This protects quality and maintains energy discipline.

---

This file alone should enable anyone to run Niveshak without external documentation. Every engine, every ritual, every file to attach, every output expected.

---

## 🔵 SUNDAY | 9:00PM – 12:00AM

### 9:00PM–9:30PM: ENERGY & CLARITY CHECK

**Purpose**: Never force mediocre output

**Process**:
1. Ask yourself: "Do I have energy and clarity for quality work tonight?"
2. If NO → Reschedule to Monday, don't compromise quality
3. If YES → Proceed to Idea Kill Zone

**No engine needed** — Personal check

---

### 9:30PM–10:00PM: IDEA KILL ZONE

**Engine**: Chief Strategist (ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking)

**Files to Open**:
- `02-engines/engine_01_chief_strategist.md`
- `00-bible/niveshak_bible.md`
- `00-bible/frameworks_index.md`
- `00-bible/post_index.md`
- `04-operations/idea_backlog.md`

**Prompt** (to ChatGPT):
```
You are Niveshak's Chief Strategist. Sunday Idea Kill Zone.

TASK: Propose 3-5 content ideas for this week and ruthlessly evaluate each.

ATTACHED:
- niveshak_bible.md (philosophy/voice)
- frameworks_index.md (check what needs reinforcement)
- post_index.md (avoid redundancy)
- idea_backlog.md (previously reframed ideas)

For each idea evaluate:
- Signature metric (one killer number)
- Edge dimensions (must hit 2+)
- Framework (existing to reinforce or new to introduce)
- Coffee Test (would friend feel smarter?)
- Redundancy (check last 10 posts)
- Verdict: PROCEED / REFRAME / KILL

Be ruthless. 30-50% kill rate is healthy.
```

**Expected Output**: 3-5 ideas with verdicts

**Post-Run Actions**:
- Log KILLED ideas in `00-bible/killed_ideas.md`
- Save REFRAMED ideas to `04-operations/idea_backlog.md`
- Select 1-2 PROCEED ideas for this week
- Note which frameworks need reinforcement

MANDATORY STRUCTURE:
1. Strong opening sentence (data, anomaly, contrast, or framework)
2. Lead with ONE killer metric or anomaly early
3. Apply at least ONE existing framework
4. Hit at least 2 Niveshak Edge dimensions
5. Include ONE explicit uncertainty admission
6. Include ONE thesis-breaking or invalidation metric
7. Include a “What we’re watching” section at the end
8. Include at least ONE second-order implication

Framework used:
Signature metric:
Edge dimensions hit:
Invalidation metric:
Second-order implication:

--- MASTER DRAFT ---
[Institutional-grade post, 600–900 words]

--- WHAT WE’RE WATCHING ---
[3–5 bullet points on forward-looking mechanics, NOT predictions]

--- UNCERTAINTY NOTE ---
[One paragraph admitting what we cannot know yet]
```

**Expected Output**: Draft content

---

#### Step 2: Contrarian Validator (For Macro/Governance/Novel Framework Posts)

**Engine**: Perplexity Pro

**Trigger**: Run if post has macro, governance, or regulatory angle

**Prompt**:
```
What credible data or narratives contradict this thesis?
List sources. Focus on institutional or regulatory counterpoints.
```

**Expected Output**: 3-5 contrarian bullets with sources

- **Signal Collector**: Noise vs. signal ratio degrading? Missing key events?
- **Red Team**: Too lenient? Too harsh? Drift from institutional challenge?
- **Platform Adapter**: Voice preservation breaking? Banned tells creeping in?

**If degradation suspected**:
→ Flag in `04-operations/model_health_log.md`  
→ Re-run benchmark next week  
→ Switch model if needed

**Critical Rule**: If >2 degradation flags for same engine in a month → investigate model replacement
