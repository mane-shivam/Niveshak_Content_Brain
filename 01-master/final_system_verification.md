# ✅ FINAL SYSTEM CROSS-VERIFICATION

**Date:** 25 January 2026
**Audit Type:** End-to-End Completeness Check
**Status:** COMPLETE

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE VERDICT

✅ **YES — System is architecturally complete.**

Both critical failures identified are now structurally impossible:

1. ✅ **Verification destroying insight** → Fixed by ENGINE 05A + multi-example pools
2. ✅ **Dead institutional voice** → Fixed by Bible v2 + ENGINE 08/09 updates
