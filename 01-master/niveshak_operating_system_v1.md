# 🧠 NIVESHAK OPERATING SYSTEM v1.0

**The Complete Institutional Playbook**

---

## EXECUTION HIERARCHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Priority order when conflicts exist:**

1. **`daily_checklist.md`** = **Execution authority** (timing, prompts, sequencing)
2. **`niveshak_bible.md`** = **Philosophy & voice** (how we think and write)
3. **`niveshak_operating_system_v1.md`** = **Architecture** (how engines work)
4. **Individual engine files** = **Implementation** (detailed specs)

**Critical Rule**: Any lower-level file must obey higher-level files.  
If `daily_checklist.md` says to do X at 9pm, but this OS suggests Y at 10pm → **daily_checklist wins**.

This hierarchy prevents drift when documentation evolves at different speeds.

This is the single canonical document encoding the entire Niveshak content production system. Everything else in this repository expands on what's defined here.

## SECTION 1: SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### The Core Cadence

**Sunday–Tuesday–Friday Publishing Schedule**

- **Sunday Brief** (9pm–12am): Framework-driven weekly analysis
- **Tuesday Audit** (Research Mon, Publish Tue): Deep quarterly forensics
- **Friday Macro** (Research Thu, Publish Fri): Regime-level market insights

### The Learning Arc Philosophy

Niveshak teaches before reacting. Structure:
1. **Framework Introduction** → Teach the mental model
2. **Framework Application** → Apply to current events
3. **Framework Reinforcement** → Reference in future content

### Teaching Before Reacting

80% diagnosis (what happened and why), 20% scenario (if X then Y), 0% prediction (what will happen).

## SECTION 4: QUALITY GATES & FAILURE PROTOCOLS

### Pre-Publication Checklist

Every post must pass ALL:

1. **Killer Number Rule**: One signature metric that anchors the post
2. **2-Edge Minimum**: Hits at least 2 of 5+1 Niveshak Edge dimensions
3. **Invalidation Metric**: Clear data point that would prove analysis wrong
4. **Coffee Test**: Would a smart friend feel smarter after hearing this?
5. **Voice Check**: Zero banned AI tells, institutional tone maintained
6. **Red Team Passed**: Adversarial challenge completed, holes addressed
7. **Energy Governor Passed**: Post NOT written when mental clarity < threshold (if Energy Check failed, writing postponed, never forced)

### Rewrite vs. Kill Thresholds

**Rewrite** if:
- Core idea is sound but execution is weak
- Can be fixed in < 2 hours
- Framework is novel even if application needs work

**Kill** if:
- Fails Coffee Test fundamentally
- Redundant with recent content
- Can't hit 2+ Edge dimensions even with rewrite
- Would require > 2 hours to fix

### Failure Recovery Protocol

When a published post receives critical feedback or proves wrong:

**Step 1: Acknowledge Immediately**
- Reply to critic within 24 hours
- Thank them for the challenge

**Step 2: Investigate**
- Engine: Chief Editor
- Determine: Is criticism valid?

**Step 3: Correct Publicly**
- Small error: Update post with correction note
- Medium error: Post update explaining what changed
- Large error: Publish separate correction post

**Step 4: Extract Learning**
- Log in `04-operations/failure_log.md`
- Update engine prompts if systematic issue
- Share learning with all engines

**Step 5: Reinforce Process**
- Why did quality gates fail?
- How do we prevent recurrence?
- If failure traced to fatigue: Log as Process Failure, reinforce Energy Governor

## SECTION 6: VALIDATION & SECOND-LAYER CHECKS

### Layer 1: Red Team (Mandatory)
Every analytical post challenged before publishing

### Layer 2: Contrarian Validator (Mandatory for High-Impact Posts)

**Engine**: Perplexity Pro (finance + web connectors)

**Trigger**:
- All macro posts
- All governance posts
- Any post with regulatory interpretation
- Any post with novel framework

**Prompt Template**:
```
What credible data or narratives contradict this thesis?
List sources. Focus on institutional or regulatory counterpoints.
```

**Output**:
- 3-5 contrarian bullets
- Source links

**Post-Run**:
- Log contradictions in research notes
- If unresolved contradiction exists → Red Team rerun required

### Layer 3: Chief Editor Monthly Audit
First Saturday of month, review all posts for drift

### Layer 4: Framework Reinforcement Tracker
Saturday review ensures frameworks compound, not forgotten

### Layer 5: Post-Mortem Loop
Underperforming posts analyzed for lessons

---

## SECTION 7: MEMORY & DRIFT PROTECTION

### Memory Systems

**Framework Memory**: `frameworks_index.md` tracks all frameworks, reinforcement dates  
**Post Memory**: `post_index.md` prevents redundancy  
**Philosophy Memory**: `niveshak_bible.md` + monthly Chief Editor audits  
**Failure Memory**: `failure_log.md` ensures learning from mistakes

### Framework Reinforcement Tracker

`frameworks_index.md` must track:
- First Introduced Date
- Last Reinforced Date
- Reinforcement Count

**Rule**: No framework may go 4+ weeks without reinforcement.  
Saturday audit flags any framework approaching this limit.

### Drift Prevention

**Voice Drift**: Monthly random post audit for AI tells  
**Framework Drift**: Check frameworks being applied correctly  
**Quality Drift**: Verify quality gates still enforced  
**Philosophy Drift**: Compare recent posts to Bible  
**Prediction Leakage Audit**: Monthly scan for price targets, directional language, implicit forecasts (any violation logged, prompt updated)

**Red Flags**:
- Banned phrases appear
- Predictions creep in
- Framework reinforcement gaps > 4 weeks
- Zero post mortems (means we're not being honest about failures)

### Post-Mortem Integration

**Before Starting Any New Draft**:
→ Review previous post post-mortem notes  
→ Fix at least one weakness discovered

This prevents repeating mistakes across content cycles.

---

## SECTION 8: ENGAGEMENT & COMMENT SYSTEM

### Comment Engine Guidelines

**Praise Replies**: Brief, grateful, no false modesty  
Example: "Glad this framework resonated. Would be interesting to see how it applies to [related company]."

**Criticism Replies**: Engage respectfully, investigate if valid  
Example: "This is a fair challenge. The data I used was [source]. If you're seeing different numbers, please share—I'll investigate."

**Question Replies**: Answer with value, consider turning into content  
Example: "Great question. The difference between GMV and revenue is... [explanation]. This might warrant a dedicated post."

**Troll Handling**: Ignore or short factual response, never engage emotionally

**Timing**: Respond to high-signal comments within 24-48 hours

### High-Signal Engagement Protocol

**Rules**:
- High-signal comments must be answered within 24 hours
- Replies must add value for silent readers, not just the commenter
- Never reply with thanks-only messages

**Conversion Rule**:
If a question appears twice or from high-signal reader:
→ Log in `high_signal_readers.md`
→ Flag as potential Sunday Brief or Audit topic

**Trust Rule**:
When corrected by a credible reader:
→ Acknowledge publicly
→ Log in `failure_log.md`
→ Reinforce framework in next cycle

---

## SECTION 9: MARKET CORRESPONDENT & RANDOM POSTS

### Market Correspondent Rules

**Frequency**: Max 3 unscheduled posts per week  
**Trigger**: Insight > trend (only when we have novel angle on breaking news)  
**Style**: Brief, no frameworks, direct observation  
**Ban**: No predictions, no hype, no "breaking news" drama

**Example Good Post**:
> "SEBI just updated related-party transaction disclosure norms. Effective next quarter, companies must disclose pricing methodology. This closes a major loophole."

**Example Bad Post**:
> "Market crashes 2%! What's happening?" ❌

### Integration Rule

**Weekly Digest Connection**:
- At least 1 Market Correspondent insight per week must feed into Weekly Digest
- If a correspondent post touches a framework topic:
  → Must be referenced or reinforced in Sunday Brief within 2 weeks

**Drift Guard**:
If >3 correspondent posts in a week OR zero framework linkage in 3 weeks:
→ Suspend correspondent engine for 1 week

### Weekly Recap (Saturday)

**X & Reddit Engagement Summary**: Note high-signal conversations, questions that could become content

## SECTION 11: SIGNATURE METRIC SYSTEM (BRAND IMPRINTING)

Each week MUST select exactly ONE signature metric as the weekly anchor:
- Cash Conversion Ratio (CCR)
- CFO/PAT Ratio
- Earnings Yield vs Bond Yield
- Working Capital Days
- ROCE/ROE Gap
- Promoter Pledge Velocity
- Custom metrics fitting the week's theme

This metric must:
- Appear in at least one main post (Sunday/Tuesday/Friday)
- Be referenced across multiple posts when applicable
- Be logged in `frameworks_index.md` as "Weekly Anchor Metric"

**Purpose**: Brand imprinting—readers start to expect and look for Niveshak's signature metric lens.

---

## SECTION 12: MAINTENANCE & QUARTERLY REVIEWS

### Quarterly Model Stack Review

**First Saturday of Q2, Q3, Q4, Q1**:
- Re-benchmark model performance across all 12 engines
- Replace any engine whose output quality degrades
- Validate wrapper quality (Perplexity, Antigravity)
- Document any model changes in this file

**Metric**: If > 30% of Red Team verdicts are REWRITE/KILL for a specific engine → investigate model performance
